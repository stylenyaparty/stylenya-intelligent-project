# API App

The API app implements clean architecture and exposes business capabilities through HTTP endpoints. It owns deterministic rules and optionally calls LLM services for narrative insights.

## Key areas

- Application use cases: apps/api/src/application
- Domain rules and entities: apps/api/src/domain
- Infrastructure adapters: apps/api/src/infrastructure
- HTTP interface layer: apps/api/src/interfaces

## Contracts

See the API contract for endpoint definitions and conventions:
