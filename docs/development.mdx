# Development Guide

This repo contains two apps under apps:

- apps/api: backend API and domain logic
- apps/web: frontend dashboard

## High-level workflow

1. Install dependencies in each app folder.
2. Configure environment variables for local development.
3. Run the API and Web apps using their local dev scripts.

Refer to the app-specific README files for the latest commands and environment configuration:

- apps/api/README.md
- apps/web/README.md
